			<h1>New album 'fantasy' out now</h1>
			<p>
			M83 announces the details of his new full-length album, FANTASY. In addition to this news, M83 has shared
			the sweeping, transformative first cut “Oceans Niagara”. Accompanying the track is a video directed by his
			long-time creative collaborator, filmmaker (Knife + Heart, You And The Night) and brother Yann Gonzalez.
			</p>
			<p>
			“BEYOND ADVENTURE”, Gonzalez sings into a trademark M83 swirl of synths & guitars. These are the only two
			words in the entirety of “Oceans Niagara”, a proclamation with an ellipsis, and the most apt tone-setting
			for the evocative, sense-amplifying journey that is Fantasy.
			</p>
			<p>
			For Gonzalez, Fantasy‘s direction and aesthetic was immediately clear. “I wanted this record to be very
			impactful live,” he says. “The idea was to come back with something closer to the energy of Before The Dawn
			Heals Us. The combination of guitars and synths is always in my music, but it’s maybe more present on this
			new record than on the previous ones.”
			</p>
			<p>
			Reserved in nature, Gonzalez also sought to continue a trend that has become more prominent in his recent
			albums. “I wanted to be more present lyrically and vocally even if that was daunting at first,” he states.
			“I thought if I could achieve that, this album will be more personal than those that came before.”
			</p>
			<p>
			Fantasy, M83’s 9th studio album, proves a towering sensory delight and marks his most personal album to
			date, an alternate world that Gonzalez has created as an escape from the disconnected world we live in
			today.
